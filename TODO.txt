- Get model checkpointing working with the Jax/Flax framework

- Start Google doc with "Short 3-5 page commentary on the HW that explains 
    the key concepts in the paper(s) and how the HW engages with them 
    in a systematic way."

- Develop Jax model that takes in game state and outputs vector of action weights, 
    as well as expected value of game

- Write code to compare two competing models with win-rate (for autograder)

- Optimizer loop for Jax model, assuming training examples known

- MCTS class 

- Training loop with MCTS training examples
